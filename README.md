# Automation-of-emails-reply-and-modify-labels-using-openai
This project provides a backend server that automates the process of replying to client emails and adding labels based on the email's content. By sending the email subject and a snippet of the content to the OpenAI API, the server receives a response and takes the appropriate actions.

## Features
Automated Email Replies: The server uses OpenAI's API to generate responses to client emails.
Labeling Emails: Based on the content, emails are labeled as "Interested," "Not Interested," or "More Info."
